An evolving document to aggregate our learning from Software craftsmanship over time

# Red Panda Vision document

Red Panda Innovation Labs is a team of software craftsmen who care deeply about the software they write and the products they develop. The founders of Red Panda came together because they loved creating software which could solve real business problems thereby creating value for the organisation Red Panda is creating software for, and, capturing part of the value as project development fee and / or equity in the product.

There are a few shared values we believe help us create good software and these underpin the culture we would like to see at Red Panda

## A software craftsman is sincere towards his craft.
When someone sponsors a software project, he implicitly places immense amount of trust in the engineering team who is going to work on it. The sponsor allocates his hard earned money to a project in the hope that this engineering team will deliver software which will help create value for him. He may not be the most experienced project sponsor and may need support and guidance to help achieve his goals. A software craftsman understands this commitment and risk that the sponsor takes and that this sponsorship is what keeps the engineer’s love for his craft alive. Every project is an opportunity for the engineer to apply his new found knowledge and experience to practical use and thereby gain more experience and feedback about his craft. A software engineer respects his sponsor’s aspiration and helps him realise his goals.

## A software craftsman is humble.
A software craftsman understands well that his lifetime is not enough to cover the entire knowledge in the field of software engineering. He makes sincere efforts to learn and evaluate new developments and technologies without biases towards his existing knowledge. He is not judgemental about technologies. He is highly aware of the environments in which certain technologies can be helpful and in which others. He always listens to views which are against his beliefs with an open mind and engages in constructive enquiry and healthy discussions with an objective to understand the point of view of other participants and arrive at a logical conclusion which is agreed and very well understood by everyone. If this changes the software craftsman’s original view, he accepts it gracefully and feels thankful to the participants to have helped him discover a better perspective.

## A software craftsman cares deeply about the people around him.
One of the most beautiful things about the software engineering community is that we love sharing our work and derive immense satisfaction in helping each other. This is why we have a huge amount of open source projects and people volunteering their time to guide and help others in the community solve problems. This has helped our craft progress at incredible pace. If our society could also find a way to adopt this value in a practical manner it could benefit mankind at large. A software craftsman is blessed to be part of this community and its his moral responsibility to ensure he doesn’t let his community down. More importantly he shares this love for helping the community grow and benefit from his knowledge, work and experience. He derives satisfaction from being able to teach others and help them grow into better craftsmen and he has the patience, will and mental tenacity to answer any kind of questions from people inquisitive about any aspect of software engineering. He also has the maturity to claim he is not aware of somethings when applicable and takes the effort to learn and improve his knowledge base to be able to answer such questions at the next opportunity. He also helps guide seekers to the right resources, to the best of his knowledge .

## A software craftsman values concepts over knowledge.
This is not to say a software craftsman is not knowledgeable. Knowledge and concepts are in someways related as well. A software craftsman can see through layers of abstractions over which he works and can explain how something works to the deepest level. A software craftsman is able to achieve this through a comprehensive study of technologies through media such as books and documentation.

## A software craftsman likes to keep his mind sharp and agile.
A software craftsman cares about and challenges his mental and physical abilities by ensuring a healthy work and living environment and by trying to solve complex engineering problems.

At Red Panda we believe, people with the above shared values, will be able to create quality software products which shall deliver long term value. Often people ask, what is unique about your organisation.weI ask them what is purpose of the question. What really matters is if we are doing something valuable. To still answer that question, we do not know enough about all the organisations in the world to state if we are unique and frankly we don’t think its worth our time to find that out. We believe the above values matter and they help in delivering good values. If there are more organisations outside Red Panda who can benefit from this value system, we welcome them to share it and become more like us. If there are organisations which have things Red Panda can learn from, we seek their guidance in helping us become more like them.
